        Player versus environment game types makes up the majority of the game.
        PvE story missions can be played either solo or as part of a "fireteam" of up to three players.
        Initially, although there was an order to the story missions, they could be played in any order as more missions became available.

    <code>
        In addition to these player versus environment challenges, player versus player combat exists in what is called the Crucible.
        The Crucible, which can have a maximum of twelve players depending on game type,
        contains playlists of PvP modes, including "Control", "Clash", "Rumble", and "Skirmish".
